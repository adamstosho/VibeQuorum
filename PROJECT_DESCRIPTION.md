# VibeQuorum - Project Description

VibeQuorum is an innovative Q&A platform designed specifically for Web3 developers, combining community-driven knowledge with AI assistance and on-chain token rewards. The platform addresses the critical need for reliable, incentivized technical support in the rapidly evolving Web3 ecosystem.

Developers can post questions about Solidity, dApp integration, DeFi protocols, and blockchain tooling. Community members provide answers, vote on content quality, and accept the best solutions. An integrated AI assistant generates draft answers using OpenAI, which users can refine and submit. This hybrid approach accelerates problem-solving while maintaining community expertise.

The platform's unique value proposition lies in its on-chain reward system. Contributors earn VibeTokens (an ERC-20 token) when their answers are accepted or reach upvote thresholds. Questioners also receive bonus tokens when their questions are answered, creating a self-sustaining knowledge economy. All rewards are distributed transparently via smart contracts on Base Sepolia, ensuring trust and accountability.

Built as a full-stack application with Next.js frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database, and Solidity smart contracts, VibeQuorum demonstrates production-ready architecture. The platform includes an admin panel for reward management, comprehensive security measures including role-based access control, and support for multiple EVM-compatible networks.

VibeQuorum represents the convergence of AI and blockchain technologies, embodying the "vibe coding" philosophy by leveraging AI tools for rapid development while using blockchain for transparent, decentralized incentives. The platform is designed to scale from a hackathon MVP to a full-featured community-governed DAO, with future plans including reputation-to-governance migration, advanced AI features, and token staking for bounty-style questions.
